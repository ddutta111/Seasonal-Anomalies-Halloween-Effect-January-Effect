# Seasonal-Anomalies-Halloween-Effect-January-Effect
Quantitative Independent Research Project (MSc Finance Dissertation at the University of Leicester)


## Project Overview
This research project explores the existence of the Halloween Effect and January Effect in stock markets across five countries: the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and India. Using monthly stock indices data from January 2000 to December 2018, the study investigates whether these calendar anomalies persist in both developed and developing markets.

## Key Findings
**Halloween Effect and January Effect:** The study finds no significant evidence of a positive Halloween or January effect in these five large stock markets. Stock prices do not exhibit significant increases during the winter months (November-April).
**Seasonal Risk and Returns:** Higher returns during the summer months (May-October) are associated with higher risks. However, returns during November through April were slightly higher (but not significantly) before the 2008 financial crisis, and significantly lower in all five countries post-crisis.
**Trading Volumes and Interest Rates:** The study shows that trading volumes do not significantly influence stock prices during winter. Interest rates, while significant and negatively correlated with stock prices, do not cause significant changes in equity returns during winter months.
**Implications for Investors:** The findings suggest that traditional calendar-based trading strategies, such as "Sell in May and Go Away," may no longer be effective, especially in large and developed markets. The study recommends a "winter short strategy" for Canada, where a negative Halloween effect was identified.

## Data & Methodology
**Data Sources:** Monthly stock returns for large market-cap weighted indices from five countries (FTSE 100, S&P 500, S&P TSX, ASX 200, and NIFTY 500) were used. Additional data on trading volumes and interest rates were also collected to analyze their effects on stock returns (Time period: Jan 2000 - Dec 2018).
**Variables**: The study used average index returns as the dependent variable, with independent variables including months, country IDs, the Halloween indicator, adjusted Halloween dummy, January dummy, average trading volume, and average interest rates.

## Technical tools used:
-Bloomberg, Yfinance for Data Collection
--STATA, SPSS and Advanced Excel for statistical data exploration, analysis and visualization
MS-Word for Research reporting/presentation

## Conclusion
The qunatitative research concludes that the Halloween and January effects are becoming less significant, if not entirely extinct, in these markets. It suggests that market anomalies might be diminishing due to changes in the global trading environment, such as the rise of algorithmic trading and shifting economic conditions. Further research is needed to better understand these trends and develop effective trading strategies for the future.

Future Research
Given the fast-evolving nature of global financial markets, further investigation into calendar anomalies is recommended. Future studies could consider factors like algorithmic trading, political shifts, and social media influence to provide more accurate insights into seasonal market movements.
